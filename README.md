IBM_Loan_Project - Machine Learning with Python
With the Loan_train dataset from Kaggle after data preprocessing:
* Recognizing the values that need to be transformed to find an accurate predictive model for loan applicants.
* Transform the values and apply machine learning models.
* Summarize from various machine learning models and re-run after handling data imbalance using Smote, NearMiss, and Oversampling methods.
* Make a conclusion about which data processing method brings maximum effectiveness for the model.
